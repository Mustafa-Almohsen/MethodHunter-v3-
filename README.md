üß™ Testing Locally (Insecure Lab)

You can spin up a deliberately vulnerable server locally to test MethodHunter:

1. Download a file named as insecure.py
2. Run the server: sudo python3 insecure.py
3. Upload a file manually: curl -X PUT htt*://127.0.0.1:80/test.txt -d '{"key": "Hello,This is Mustafa-Almohsn"}'
4. Or test with the tool:

- python3 method_hunter-v3.py -u htt*://127.0.0.1:80
